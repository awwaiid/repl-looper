# Norns REPL-LOOPER

> Anagogically integrated UI for Norns / Matron / Grid

<img src="docs/logo.png" align="right" style="padding-left: 1em" />

Experimental performance and creative tool, mashing together several things that I like. REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop, a code execution console) for interactive code creating. Grid to have a tactile UI (maybe we'll throw in a midi pedal too). Dance between sound-generating code, recording commands, looping, slicing, mixing, generating tools and patterns on the fly, and maybe make some self-modifying loops.

# Installation

Install directly from maiden or by running this in the maiden/matron console:

```lua
;install https://github.com/awwaiid/repl-looper
```

Then start `repl-looper` on the norns.

There are two ways to interact with `repl-looper` -- Directly on the norns with a USB keyboard, or with a web browser. Both ways work with a monome-grid (optional).

<img src="docs/20211227-demo-running.gif" width="40%" border=1 align="right" />
You can access the web interface at:

http://bit.ly/norns-repl-looper or http://norns.local/api/v1/dust/code/repl-looper/ui/dist/repl-looper.html

Both interfaces offer the same REPL functionality, but the web-UI adds some further visualization.

# Basic Usage

The workflow is an alternative to maiden's REPL with a few different features and style. The basic idea is the same -- you run Lua commands and see the results. Verify that everything is running with some simple math, type in:

```lua
2+2
```

Which should output `4` (give or take). While you can run any Lua commands you want, `repl-looper` comes with a built-in engine and a bunch of tools. The built-in engine is a mash-up of Timber, Goldeneye, and Molly the Poly, along with some lua wrappers. Try these commands:

```lua
-- Timber piano shortcut
p'c'
p'd'
p(68)

molly:note(60)
molly:randomize()
molly:note(62)
molly:stop()
```

Press `<tab>` for some completions. You can press `<up>` or `<down>` arrows to select previous commands or tab-completion choices. Press `<enter>` without any command to run the previous command again.

Next thing to play with is loops/sequences. There are 8 pre-defined 16-step loops, one for each row, put into variables `a` to `h`. Start by recording into loop `a`:

```lua
a:rec()
```

Loop `a` is now playing and recording! You can see the current step and steps with recorded events on the grid. Now run:

```
p'c'
```

Wait a bit, and then run:

```
p'd'
```

The loop is playing and will wrap back around at 16 steps and keep recording, so if you add more events they stack up on top of each other. Now try:

```
a:stop() -- this stops recording but keeps playing
a:stop() -- stop again to also stop playing
```

At this point press some of the grid buttons to trigger all the events recorded at that step immediately (this ignores their sub-step timing). Here are a few more things to try:

```
a:show() -- show the loop contents
a:play() -- start loop again
a:clear() -- erase loop contents
```

Now that you have the script running on norns and the local UI up in a browser and everything working together, read through [README Reference](#reference) below and [Techniques](techniques.lua) to get more some ideas!

# Reference

## UI
* Web UI
  * On the right is output, including errors
  * Loops on the grid will be visualized as they are played, and turn red in record mode
* Use `<up>` and `<down>` arrows to select commands and output from history
* Press `<enter>` to execute the most recent item from history (re-run command)
* Use `<tab>` to see what functions/methods are available (tab-complete)
* Simple functions with no parameters are automatically evaluated, so you use `p` instead of `p()`
* Common 808 samples are loaded under `s808.<tab>` and have shortcuts like `CP`

# Library and Live-Coding Helpers

There are a lot of pre-defined variables, functions, and objects to make live-coding with `repl-looper` convenient.

## Pre-defined variables/functions
  * `a`..`h` -- loops, one per grid-row
    * `loops` is a table of all eight, so you can do `all(loops):amp(0, 10)` to fade everything at once
  * `p` -- a Timber-based piano sample player
  * `piano` -- the underlying piano sample (via Timber)
    * You can do things like `piano:reverse()`
  * `molly` -- an instance of Molly, which wraps Molly The Poly
    * `molly2` ... `molly8` -- more pre-defined Mollys
    * `mollies` is a table of all eight, so you can do `all(mollies):stop()`
    * Tip: ```h:gen("molly:note(`60+m`)")``` will put one molly-note on each step for a playable synth!
  * Pre-loaded 808 samples in `s808.*` with these shortcuts
    * `BD`, `BD`, `CH`, `CY`, `LC`, `MC`, `RS`, `BS`, `CL`, `HC`, `LT`, `MT`, `SD`, `CB`, `CP`, `HT`, `MA`, `OH`
    * Call with `CP` or `CP()` or `s808.CP:play()`
    * Modify with `s808.BS:amp(2)`
    * Tip: `h:gen(keys(s808))` will put one sample on each step for a playable drum kit!

## Loop

There are 8 pre-defined loops, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h`. Each loops is assigned to a row on the grid. So `a` is on the first row and `h` is on the bottom row.

Here we use loop `a` as the example, but you could run these commands on any loop.

* `myloop = Loop.new()` -- Create a new Loop (I usually use `a`..`h` pre-defined loops instead)
* `a.current_step` -- current step (integer)
* `a:setLength(steps)` -- Set the number of steps (quarter-notes)
* `a:show()` -- Convert into a lua-style string and show it
* Control loop playback
  * `a:play()` -- Start playing and looping
  * `a:once()` -- Play once but do not loop
  * `a:stop()` -- Stop playing or recording
  * `a:noLoop()` -- Stop looping when we get to the end
  * `a:nextStep()` -- Increment the current step to the next step
  * `a:prevStep()` -- Decrement the current step to the previous step
  * `a:setStep(step)` -- Set the current step
* Modify or generate loop contents
  * `a:rec()` -- Start recording. Commands run in the REPL get recorded at the current time. You can also trigger commands by pressing grid buttons.
  * `a:clear()` -- Remove all events
  * `a:put(step, command)` -- Assign a command at a specific step
    * This is handy for building up a set of controls
  * `a:gen(code_string, condition, offset)` -- Generate events in a loop programmatically, with macro expansion. Very powerful!
    * `a:gen("CH")` -- puts the "CH" function on every step
    * `a:gen("CH", 1/2)` -- puts the "CH" on every half step
    * `a:gen("CH", 2, 3)` -- puts the "CH" on every other step starting with step 3
    * `a:gen("CH", { 1, 3, 4.5 })` -- puts the "CH" on the given steps (even fractional)
    * `a:gen({"BD","SD","CP"})` -- puts each one on each step
    * Macro expansion
      * Backticks are evaluated for each generated event
      * Within macros, you can use `n` for the one-based step/column and `m` for the zero-based step/colum
      * ```a:gen("p(`50+m`)")``` -- Generates `p(50)`, `p(51)`, `p(52)`, and so on filling up all 16 steps
      * ```a:gen("piano:filterFreq(`100 * n`)")``` -- Generates low-pass for 100 hz, 200 hz, 300 hz, etc
      * You can pass a second parameter to `gen` for grid button-release events. This way you can start playing a note on button-down and stop the note on button-release
      * Button release example: ```a:gen("molly:note(`60+m`)", "molly:offNote(`60+m`)")``` -- only for grid triggered events the "off" event will be executed on button release
  * `a:quantize()` -- Events are recorded at sub-steps by default; this immediately rounds them to the nearest step
  * `a:clone(other_loop)` -- Copy this loop onto another (empty the other out)
  * `a:merge(other_loop)` -- Merge other_loop into this one. New loop is the longest of the two
    * `other_loop` is cleared
  * `a:split(other_loop)` -- Split the current loop, putting some events into `other_loop` and keeping some
    * This works by looking at the text of the commands to judge similarity (edit-distance) to the first event-command in the loop. Events that are on-average similar to the first event are kept, events that are different are put into the other loop.
    * `a:split(other_loop, base_cmd)` -- You can pass in a base-command and it will try to keep things like that in the current loop
  * `a:slice(sample, step_offset, step_count, reverse)` -- Take a Goldeneye/Timber sample and slice it
    * This is effectively a complex generator of frame-offsets in the sample playback
    * If `reverse` is true then start from the end of the sample
  * `a:align(other_loop)` -- Slides events into alignment with another loop based on the current step of each; does not modify the loop otherwise
    * So if loop `a` and loop `b` are playing but their current-steps (playheads) are different, this will shift loop `a` events and current-step so that they are lined up
    * This is useful if you either recorded or played the loops visually out of sync, but you like they way they currently sound while they are playing and want to make them LOOK in-sync the way they sound
    * A fun thing to do is `all(loops):align(a)`
* Control loop dynamics
  * The whole output of a loop goes through its own Supercollider track for all of the bundled engines. The result is that you can modify the output of the whole loop at once
  * `a:amp(level)` -- Set the amp (0..1) for the whole loop; the included engine loops everything through the triggered loop!
    * `a:amp(level, lag_time)` -- Fade to the given volume over the given number of seconds
    * Example: `a:amp(0, 10)` will fade out the whole loop over 10 seconds
  * `a:pan(amount)` -- Pan the whole loop. Panning goes from -1 (left) to 1 (right), and 0 is center

## Engine wrappers

* `t1 = Timber.new("path/to/file.wav")` -- Timber wrapper (works with .ogg too!)
* `s1 = Sample.new("path/to/file.wav")` -- Goldeneye wrapper (works with .ogg too!)
* `m1 = Molly.new()` -- Molly the Poly wrapper (you can have several!)
  * Tip: `molly:randomize()` -- Randomize the synth params!
  * `molly` and `molly2..molly8` are pre-created for convenience
* Once you have an instance, use tab (ex `t1:<tab>`) to explore! There are wrapper methods that generally do what the engine does
  * Try this with the built-in `molly` sample by typing `molly:<tab>`
* You could of course use any engine you like! Only a few commands like `Loop:slice(...)` method depend on these wrappers. Otherwise this is arbitrary lua code getting sequenced

## BONUS: `all` object wrapper
* This function can be used on a table of objects and then call a given method on each of them
* `all(mollies):stop()` -- All the pre-created mollies are stored in `mollies`, this stops them all!
* `all(loops):amp(0, 10)` -- All the pre-created loops are stored in `loops`, this fades them all out!
* `all{a,b,c}:play()` -- Play all three loops, equivalent of `a:play();b:play();c:play()`
* `all{a,b,c}:play(1):amp(1, 10)` -- Chained command that both plays and fades-in the loops

# Development

When developing you can run the Web-UI directly on your laptop, but you'll need to use docker or install dependencies (nodejs/npm). You get live-reload of changes and such. Slightly-evil the `dist` dir is then checked in to git for serving from the norns/maiden webserver. For the UI (a VueJS app):

```sh
cd ui

# Direct
npm install
npm run dev

# OR Docker, if you like
docker-compose up
```

On the norns side we need to run the lua server-side. During dev I do it this way:

```sh
# Auto-push to norns
./util/watch-sync.sh
```

# Future Ideas

* Grid on screen
  * Show events
  * Click to do the same thing as the grid button press?
* Mash up editor and REPL
  * Like a notebook but worse
  * Let the code edit the code
  * Constant fzf-style autocomplete
* Loop Recording / Editing Modes
  * Step first: Pick a step and record an event
  * Event sequencing: Take an event and place (or edit) the location of the event
  * Edit mode where a button-press loads all (timed) events for editing
* Sync loops together better?
* Add half-loops, like `a2`..`h2` that span coluns 9..16 on grid
